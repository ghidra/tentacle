	--make compound
		--if there is no in or out connections, it makes a ton of ports, for the array object. Need to stop that from happeneing
        --inside not getting nodes made when openning (look like it has the data though)
        	--infact the data looks almost exactly as it should.. its going to take some time to search out why it is fucking up

        	--IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE THE TENTACLE COMPOUND OPEN NODE, THE EXECUTE NODE, MIGHT BE FUCKING UP DATA FOR
        	THE NODE BEHIND IT
        	--YEP THAT IS WHAT S HAPPENEING. IF I CREATE A NODE, AND DELETE IT, THE NODE AND CONNETION OFFSET IT OFF FOR SOME REASON!!!!!!!!!

---saving bugged
---node "a" is not keeing the drop down for 'target' variable, but is keeping it for other drop downs?
---there is a permission issue when writing files. I just need to force it or something
---saving isnt grabbing the "content" ports, so when it comes back in, it doesnt have that info
---when creating a compound, i might need to make number attributes strings.. maybe
---input ports with same name will fuck up. need to change port names at creation and assign proper connections
